# Ecommerce with React.js and Vite

This project is a basic ecommerce app built with **React.js** and **Vite**. The project showcases key concepts including **React Context** for global state management and **React Router** for dynamic page routing.

## About This Project

This ecommerce application serves as a hands-on example for creating a functional React-based storefront. This eCommerce application was developed as the foundation for my step-by-step tutorial on building a functional React-based storefront.

I built this project from scratch specifically to demonstrate the process in a clear and educational way.
